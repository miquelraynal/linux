Marvell SEI (System Error Interrupt) Controller
-----------------------------------------------

Marvell SEI (System Error Interrupt) controller is an interrupt
aggregator. It receives interrupts from several sources and aggregates
them to a single interrupt line (an SPI) on the parent interrupt
controller.

This interrupt controller can handle up to 64 SEIs, a set comes from the
AP and is wired while a second set comes from the CPs by the mean of
MSIs. Each 'domain' is represented as a subnode.

Required properties:

- compatible: should be "marvell,armada-8k-sei".
- reg: SEI registers location and length.
- interrupts: identifies the parent IRQ that will be triggered.
- marvell,sei-ranges: two ranges, the first one describe wired
                      interrupts coming from the AP, the second one
                      non-wired interrupts (MSI) from the CPs.
- #interrupt-cells: number of cells to define an SEI wired interrupt
                    coming from the AP, should be 1. The cell is the IRQ
                    number.
- interrupt-controller: identifies the node as an interrupt controller
                        (AP only).
- msi-controller: identifies the node as an MSI controller (CPs only).

Example:

        sei: interrupt-controller@3f0200 {
                compatible = "marvell,armada-8k-sei";
                reg = <0x3f0200 0x40>;
                interrupts = <GIC_SPI 0 IRQ_TYPE_LEVEL_HIGH>;
                marvell,sei-ap-ranges = <0 21>;
                marvell,sei-cp-ranges = <21 43>;
                #interrupt-cells = <1>;
                interrupt-controller;
                msi-controller;
        };
