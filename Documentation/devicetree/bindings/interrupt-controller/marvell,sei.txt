Marvell SEI Interrupt Controller
-----------------------------------------------------
The Marvell SEI (System Error Interrupt) controller is an interrupt aggregator.
It receives interrupts from several sources and aggregates them to a single
interrupt line (of SEI interrupt) on the primary interrupt controller.

Required properties:
- compatible: Should be "marvell,sei"
- reg: Should contain SEI registers location and length.
- #interrupt-cells: Number of cells to define interrupts. Should be 1. The cell is the IRQ number.
- #size-cells: The size of the interrupt cell. Should be 1.
- interrupt-controller: Identifies the node as an interrupt controller.
- interrupt-parent : Indicates the node of the parent interrupt controller.
- interrupts: Identifies the IRQ nunmber of the parent IRQ controller to which the SEI is connected to.

Example:


	sei: interrupt-controller@3f0200 {
		compatible = "marvell,sei";
		reg = <0x3f0200 0x30>;
		#interrupt-cells = <1>;
		#size-cells = <1>;
		interrupt-controller;
		interrupt-parent = <&gic>;
		interrupts = <GIC_SPI 0 IRQ_TYPE_LEVEL_HIGH>;
	};
