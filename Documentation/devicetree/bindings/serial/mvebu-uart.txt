* Marvell UART : Non standard UART used in some of Marvell EBU SoCs
                 e.g., Armada-3700.

Required properties:
- compatible: "marvell,armada-3700-uart" for the first UART port or
              "marvell,armada-3700-uart-ext" for the second UART port
	      which has an extended IP and also some registers/bitfields
	      moved. Using a different compatible for this second port
	      allows to automatically select the right offsets.
- reg: offset and length of the register set for the device.
- clocks: UART reference clock used to derive the baudrate.
- interrupts: device interrupts. Each port has two interrupt lines,
              dedicated to both RX and TX interrupts so called "uart-rx"
	      and "uart-tx". UART0 has a third interrupt line which is
	      an OR of both RX and TX interrupts, so called "uart-sum".
	      The driver currently uses "uart-rx" and "uart-tx" for both
	      ports whereas older versions used only the summed
	      interrupt (when only UART0 was supported). UART0 uses
	      level interrupts while UART1 uses front interrupts.

Example:
	uart0: serial@12000 {
		compatible = "marvell,armada-3700-uart";
		reg = <0x12000 0x200>;
		clocks = <&xtalclk>;
		interrupts =
		<GIC_SPI 11 IRQ_TYPE_LEVEL_HIGH>,
		<GIC_SPI 12 IRQ_TYPE_LEVEL_HIGH>,
		<GIC_SPI 13 IRQ_TYPE_LEVEL_HIGH>;
		interrupt-names = "uart-sum", "uart-tx", "uart-rx";
		status = "disabled";
	};

	uart1: serial@12200 {
		compatible = "marvell,armada-3700-uart-ext";
		reg = <0x12200 0x30>;
		clocks = <&xtalclk>;
		interrupts =
		<GIC_SPI 30 IRQ_TYPE_EDGE_RISING>,
		<GIC_SPI 31 IRQ_TYPE_EDGE_RISING>;
		interrupt-names = "uart-tx", "uart-rx";
		status = "disabled";
	};
