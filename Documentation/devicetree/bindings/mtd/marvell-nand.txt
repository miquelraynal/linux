Marvell NAND Flash Controller (NFC)

Required properties:
- compatible: "marvell,armada370-nfc".
- reg: shall contain registers location and length for data and reg.
- interrupts: shall define the nand controller interrupt.
- #address-cells: shall be set to 1. Encode the nand CS.
- #size-cells: shall be set to 0.
- clocks: shall reference nand controller clocks.

Optional properties:
- dmas: shall reference DMA channel associated to the NAND controller.
- dma-names: shall be "rxtx".

Optional children nodes:
Children nodes represent the available nand chips.

Required properties:
- reg: shall contain the native Chip Select ids (0-3)
- marvell,rb: shall contain the native Ready/Busy ids (0-1)

Optional properties:
- nand-ecc-mode: one of the supported ECC modes ("none", "soft", "hw",
  "hw_syndrome", or "hw_oob_first").
- nand-ecc-algo: algorithm to use if previous choice was "soft"
  ("hamming" or "bch).

See Documentation/devicetree/bindings/mtd/nand.txt for generic bindings.


Examples:
nfc: nand@01c03000 {
	compatible = "allwinner,sun4i-a10-nand";
	reg = <0x01c03000 0x1000>;
	interrupts = <GIC_SPI 84 IRQ_TYPE_LEVEL_HIGH>;
	clocks = <&coredivclk 0>;
	#address-cells = <1>;
	#size-cells = <0>;
	status = "okay";
	nand-ecc-mode = "soft_bch";

	nand@0 {
		reg = <0>;
		marvell,rb = <0>;
		nand-ecc-mode = "hw";
	};
};
