Marvell NAND Flash Controller (NFC)

Required properties:
- compatible: can be one of the following:
    * "marvell,armada-8k-nand-controller"
    * "marvell,armada370-nand-controller"
    * "marvell,pxa3xx-nand-controller"
    * "marvell,armada-8k-nand" (deprecated)
    * "marvell,armada370-nand" (deprecated)
    * "marvell,pxa3xx-nand" (deprecated)
- reg: NAND flash controller memory area.
- #address-cells: shall be set to 1. Encode the NAND CS.
- #size-cells: shall be set to 0.
- interrupts: shall define the NAND controller interrupt.
- clocks: shall reference the NAND controller clock.
- marvell,system-controller: Set to retrieve the syscon node that handles
  NAND controller related registers (only required with the
  "marvell,armada-8k-nand[-controller]" compatibles).

Optional properties:
- label: see partition.txt. New platforms shall omit this property.
- dmas: shall reference DMA channel associated to the NAND controller.
- dma-names: shall be "rxtx".

Optional children nodes:
Children nodes represent the available NAND chips.

Required properties:
- reg: shall contain the native Chip Select ids (0-3)
- marvell,rb: shall contain the native Ready/Busy ids (0-1)

Optional properties:
- marvell,nand-keep-config: orders the driver not to take the timings
  from the core and leaving them completely untouched. Bootloader
  timings will then be used.
- nand-on-flash-bbt: see nand.txt.
- nand-ecc-mode: see nand.txt. Will use hardware ECC if not specified.
- nand-ecc-algo: see nand.txt. This property may be added when using
  hardware ECC for clarification but will be ignored by the driver
  because ECC mode is chosen depending on the page size and the strength
  required by the NAND chip. This value may be overwritten with
  nand-ecc-strength property.
- nand-ecc-strength: see nand.txt.
- nand-ecc-step-size: see nand.txt. This has no effect and will be
  ignored by the driver when using hardware ECC because Marvell's NAND
  flash controller does use fixed strength (1-bit for Hamming, 16-bit
  for BCH), so the step size will shrink or grow in order to fit the
  required strength. Step sizes are not completely random for all and
  follow certain patterns described in AN-379, "Marvell SoC NFC ECC".

See Documentation/devicetree/bindings/mtd/nand.txt for more details on
generic bindings.


Example:
nand_controller: nand-controller@d0000 {
	compatible = "marvell,armada370-nand-controller";
	reg = <0xd0000 0x54>;
	#address-cells = <1>;
	#size-cells = <0>;
	interrupts = <GIC_SPI 84 IRQ_TYPE_LEVEL_HIGH>;
	clocks = <&coredivclk 0>;

	nand@0 {
		reg = <0>;
		marvell,rb = <0>;
		nand-ecc-mode = "hw";
		marvell,nand-keep-config;
		nand-on-flash-bbt;
		nand-ecc-strength = <4>;
		nand-ecc-step-size = <512>;

		partitions {
			compatible = "fixed-partitions";
			#address-cells = <1>;
			#size-cells = <1>;

			partition@0 {
				label = "Rootfs";
				reg = <0x00000000 0x40000000>;
			};
		};
	};
};
