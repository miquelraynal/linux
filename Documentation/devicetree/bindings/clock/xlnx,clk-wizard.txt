Device Tree Clock bindings for the "Clocking Wizard" IP provided by Xilinx

This block can be used to generate up to 4 clock signals out of a single input
clock. It embeds a PLL to generate an intermediate clock which then feeds 4
clock dividers whose divider value can be adjusted based on the user needs.

Required properties:
 - #clock-cells: must be 1. The cell is encoding the id of the output clk
		 (from 0 to xlnx,clk-wizard-num-outputs - 1)
 - compatible: must be "xlnx,clk-wizard-5.1"
 - clocks: 2 clocks are required
 - clock-names: should contain 2 clock names: "aclk" and "clkin".
		"aclk" is driving the register interface and "clk_in" is the
		input clock signal that is used by the PLL block
 - xlnx,clk-wizard-num-outputs: this describe the number of output clocks
				(chosen at synthesization time)
 - reg: registers used to configure the Clocking wizard block

Example:

	clkwizard: clkwizard@43c20000 {
		compatible = "xlnx,clk-wizard-5.1";
		reg = <0x43c20000 0x10000>;
		clocks = <&clkc 18>, <&clkc 18>;
		clock-names = "aclk", "clk_in1";
		#clock-cells = <1>;
		xlnx,clk-wizard-num-outputs = <2>;
	};
