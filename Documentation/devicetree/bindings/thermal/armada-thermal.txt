* Marvell Armada 370/375/380/XP thermal management

Required properties:

- compatible: Should be set to one of the following:
    * marvell,armada370-thermal
    * marvell,armada375-thermal
    * marvell,armada380-thermal
    * marvell,armadaxp-thermal
    * marvell,armada-ap806-thermal
    * marvell,armada-cp110-thermal

- reg: Device's register space.
  Two entries are expected, see the examples below. The first one points
  to the status register (4B). The second one points to the control
  registers (8B).
  Note: The compatibles marvell,armada370-thermal,
  marvell,armada380-thermal, and marvell,armadaxp-thermal must point to
  "control MSB/control 1", with size of 4 (deprecated binding), or point
  to "control LSB/control 0" with size of 8 (current binding). All other
  compatibles must point to "control LSB/control 0" with size of 8.

Optionnal properties:

- interrupts: Should contain interrupt for thermal system
or
- interrupts-extended: Should contain parent node and interrupt for
                       thermal system (relevant for devices with irq-chip).
- threshold: Temperature threshold in Celsius, the threshold +/- calculated
             hysteresis (formula below) define the upper and lower watermark
             which when crossing, an interrupt will be asserted.
- hysteresis: Valid values are 0..3, following is upper/lower watermark
              calculation:
              high/low watermark = threshold +/- 0.4761 * 2^(hysteresis + 2).
              Following are the corresponding degrees corresponding to
              hysteresis value: 0=>1.9, 1=>3.8,  2=>7.6, 3=>15.2

Examples:

	/* Legacy bindings */
	thermal@d0018300 {
		compatible = "marvell,armada370-thermal";
		reg = <0xd0018300 0x4
		       0xd0018304 0x4>;
		interrupts = <GIC_SPI 78 IRQ_TYPE_LEVEL_HIGH>;
		threshold = <100>;
		hysteresis = <2>;
	};

	ap_thermal: thermal@6f8084 {
		compatible = "marvell,armada-ap806-thermal";
		reg = <0x6f808C 0x4>,
		      <0x6f8084 0x8>;
		interrupts-extended = <&sei 37>;
		threshold = <100>;
		hysteresis = <2>;
	};
